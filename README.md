# spacex_database
An example of creating a database.

Download the zip file and unzip it.
Install the pip file in a virtual enviroment to get all the needed resources.
Need squlite3 to work with the database.

Execute python spacex.py

(Some features were done just for fun).

Hope you like it.
Regards.
